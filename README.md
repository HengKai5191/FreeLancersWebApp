# FreeLancersWebAPI

FreeLancersWebAPI is an UI application that allows user to perform CRUD(create, read, update and delete) for Freelancers management. 

## Installation
[You will need FreeLancer-Management-API before run this.]
While setup in Azure is possible, it requires licensing/subscription. Due to this limitation, this setup method was not implemented.

Alternative way.
Setup by cloning
1. Clone the repository.
2. Make sure you change the Main URI/Base URI in order to consume the API.
3. I do try to release it into DLL folder and tested from my side. Screenshot as below:
